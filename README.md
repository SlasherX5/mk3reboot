# mk3reboot
Duel to death with a new take!

# How to compile and Play:
- Download all the files.
- Make sure MS Macro Assembler is installed for Visual Studio.
- Open /CODE/MK3Reboot.sln with VS2022.
- Build Debug or Release x86. Due to ASM files to compile you need to use x86 builds. 64-bit Macro assembler won't compile the ASM files!
